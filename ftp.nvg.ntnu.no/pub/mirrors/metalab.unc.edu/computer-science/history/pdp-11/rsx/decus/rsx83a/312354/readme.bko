This UIC contains the source, object modules, and task images for a game
similar to the (once) popular arcade game, BRKOUT.  To play you need:

	1 PDP-11 (or VAX-see below) computer running RSX-11M or RSX-11M+
	1 VT100 terminal at 9600 baud (Advanced Video Option NOT required)

A brief set of playing instructions are present in the file BRKOUT.DOC

Two versions of the task are provided, BKOFSL.TSK for those of you who have
a supervisor mode FCS library, and BKO.TSK for everybody else. The supervisor
mode library version runs in about 10K words of memory, and the regular
version in about 13K words. 

Task build command files are provided for both versions:
  (BKOFSL.TKB and BKO.TKB)

The source code is written mostly in RATFOR, with some assembly language.
A command file to assemble and compile the source is provided (BRKOUT.BLD)

Enjoy!!
