The UVT100 subroutine interface is designed to allow convenient  access  to  the
VT100  ANSI  Mode  Control  Sequences as defined in chapter 3 of the VT100 Users
Guide.  The calling sequence for each function is described below, together with
a description of the function.

In order for  cursor  control  of  the  VT100  to  perform  satisfactorily,  the
wraparound  feature  of  the  terminal  driver should be disabled by issuing the
MCR command "SET /NOWRAP=TI:"

The VT100 must have its ANSI/VT52 setup toggle switch  set  to  ANSI  for  these
commands  to  work.   This  can  be done manually, or a CALL UVT100(ANSI) can be
issued to ensure the terminal is set to ANSI.

Programs using UVT100 to write to a terminal must open the logical unit  of  the
terminal  with  CARRIAGECONTROL='NONE'  to  disable  Fortran  carriage  control.
Standard  Fortran  CR/LF  carriage  control  can  be  emulated  by   issuing   a
CALL UVT100(NEL) between each Fortran write.

The format of a UVT100 call is CALL UVT100(cmd,num1,num2), where:     cmd is the
mode  control  command  to  be executed,    num1 and num2 are numeric parameters
required for certain commands.

Symbolics are defined for the cmd  parameter  in  the  file  UVT100.DAT.   These
symbolics  match  those  provided in the VT100 Users Guide, and are provided for
ease of operation.

The following commands are implemented.

CALL UVT100(CUP,line,column)    position cursor to coordinates given by line
                                and column. lines are numbered 1-24 and 
                                columns 1-80. a zero is treated as a one. 
                                CUP,0,0 is the equivalent of a HOME CURSOR.
 
CALL UVT100(CUB,num)            backspace the cursor num columns. a zero is
                                treated as a one. cursor will not backspace
                                beyond left margin.
 
CALL UVT100(CUD,num)            move the cursor down num lines. a zero is
                                treated as a one. cursor will not move below
                                bottom margin.
 
CALL UVT100(CUF,num)            forward the cursor num columns. a zero is
                                treated as a one. cursor will not forward
                                beyond right margin.
 
CALL UVT100(CUU,num)            move the cursor up num lines. a zero is 
                                treated as a one. cursor will not move up 
                                beyond top margin.
 
CALL UVT100(DECDHL,num)         define active line as top or bottom of a 
                                double-height line. num=0 is the top half, 
                                and num=1 is the bottom half.

CALL UVT100(DECDWL)             define active line as a double width line.
 
CALL UVT100(DECSWL)             define active line as a single-width,
                                single-height line.
 
CALL UVT100(DECSC)              save the active cursor coordinates.
 
CALL UVT100(DECRC)              restore the cursor to the saved coordinates.
 
CALL UVT100(ED,num)             erase the display. if num=0, erase from active
                                cursor position to end of display. if num=1,
                                erase from top of display to active cursor
                                position. if num=2, erase entire display.
 
CALL UVT100(EL,num)             erase the line. if num=0, erase from active
                                cursor position to the end of line. if num=1,
                                erase from the beginning of line to the active
                                cursor position. if num=2, erase entire line.
 
CALL UVT100(SGR,num)            set graphic rendition. the only attribute
                                selectable for a VT100 without the advanced
                                video option is reverse image, num=7.
                                num=0 turns all attributes off.
 
CALL UVT100(NEL)                position cursor to beginning of next line.
 
CALL UVT100(SCS,num1,num2)      select character set. num1=0 indicates G0 set.
                                num1=1 indicates G1 set. num2=0 indicates
                                United Kingdom set. num2=1 indicates standard
                                ASCII set. num2=2 indicates special graphics
                                set. in subsequent I/O, the G0 set is selected
                                by a shift in <control O>, and the G1 set is
                                selected by a shift out <control N> embedded
                                in the data.
 
CALL UVT100(SM,num)             set DEC private mode. num is mode to be set.
                                1 = DECCKM (cursor key)
                                2 = DECANM (ANSI/VT52)
                                3 = DECCOLM (column)
                                4 = DECSCLM (scrolling)
                                5 = DECSCNM (screen)
                                6 = DECOM (origin)
                                7 = DECAWM (auto wrap)
                                8 = DECARM (auto repeating)
                                9 = DECINLM (interlace)
 
CALL UVT100(RM,num)             reset DEC private mode. num is the mode to be
                                reset. see codes listed above for set mode.
 
CALL UVT100(ANSI)               this is a VT52-compatible command to ensure
                                the terminal is set to ANSI mode. this should
                                be the first command issued in your program
                                if you are not sure the target terminal is set
                                to ANSI mode. this command will be ignored if
                                the terminal is already in ANSI mode.
