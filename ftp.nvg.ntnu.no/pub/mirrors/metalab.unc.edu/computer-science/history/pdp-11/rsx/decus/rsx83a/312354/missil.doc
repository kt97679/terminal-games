This game is similar to the arcade game, MISSILE COMMANDER.  As written, 
it must be played on a VT100 video terminal.  You have under your command
three missile bases, and six cities that you must protect from incoming
attacking bombs.  Attacking bombs consist of normal bombs, which appear
on the screen as asterisks, and smart bombs, which appear as circles.
Both types of bombs fall from the top of the screen towards your bases
and cities on the bottom. Smart bombs differ in that they are more likely
to destroy a target if not eliminated, and that they are harder to destroy.

Each of your three missile bases is equipped with ten missiles which you can 
fire at the attackers. Firing is accomplished by positioning your gunsight 
and firing a missile from one of your bases. Positioning your gunsight, which
appears as a plus sign on the screen, is accomplished by use of the VT100 
keypad keys, 1 through 9.  The keys move the gunsight in the direction 
relative to their position, that is, the 8 key moves the site up, the
3 key down and to the right, etc.  The keys do not need to be held down.
Once a key is hit, the gunsight will move in that direction until it hits
the edge of the screen, or until the 5 key is hit.  The 5 key stops the
motion of the gunsight. It takes some practice to get used to controlling
the gunsight, in particular the "move and stop", "move and stop" motions
necessary for firing.  Firing of missiles is accomplished by hitting the
"A", "S", or "D" key.  The "A" key fires a missile from the leftmose base,
the "S" key from the middle base, and the "D" key from the rightmost base.
Beneath each base appears a display of the number of missiles still remaining
to be fired from that base.  If you attempt to fire a missile from a base that
has none left, or has been destroyed, the VT100 will emit a beep to alert you.

When a missile is fired, it will explode at the location of your gunsight 
when it was fired.  There is a delay between when you fire and the
explosion occurs, based on the distance from the base to the location, so
it may be necessary to "lead" the targets you fire at.  Explosion of the
missile is indicated on the screen by a cloud that increases in size, holds
at its maximum size briefly, and then recedes to nothingness. Any bomb
positioned within the cloud will be destroyed.  It is not necessary to hold
your gunsight at its location after firing, in fact it is recommended that
you move on to the next target immediately after firing, and not wait for
the results of that missile.

The game consists of a series of attack waves.  When each wave completes,
a new (more difficult) one starts after a brief pause.  Your missile bases 
are rebuilt and rearmed with ten missiles after each wave.  Destroyed cities 
remain destroyed, except that you receive a new one for each 10000 points you 
score. Periodically, a bomber ( => ) may move across the screen and drop a 
bomb. You can destroy it just as you destroy bombs.  The game ends when all
of your cities have been destroyed.  You may also exit the game at any time
by typing a control-C. The screen can be "frozen" for interruptions or 
distractions by typing a control-S (or no-scroll) and unfrozen by typing 
a control-Q (or no-scroll).


The scoring of the game is as follows:

each city saved at the end of a wave - 100 points (**)
each missile not used during a wave  - 10 points
each bomb destroyed                  - 25 points  (**)
each smart bomb destroyed            - 50 points  (**)
each bomber airplane destroyed       - 100 points (**)

** - first wave score. these scores double on the second wave, triple on
the fourth wave, quadruple on the sixth, and so on up to the 24th wave.

Enjoy!!
