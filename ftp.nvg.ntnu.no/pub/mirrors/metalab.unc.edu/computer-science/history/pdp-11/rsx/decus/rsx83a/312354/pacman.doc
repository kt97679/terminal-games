This game is similar to the arcade game, PACMAN.  As written, it must
be played on a VT100 video terminal.  You are the PACMAN (asterisk character)
and are being chased by the four monsters - LEFTY (line feed character),
CURLY (carriage return character), FLUFFY (form feed character), and
NELLIE (new line character). You have four directional keys for motion. 
(8 is up, 2 is down, 4 is left, and 6 is right). These four keys on the VT100 
keypad correspond to the four directions. It takes a little getting used to 
this simulated version of a joystick, but it can be done.  The directional 
keys do not have to be held down. When you select a direction the PACMAN will 
move in that direction until he hits a wall or you select a new direction. If 
you select a direction in which PACMAN cannot move at the moment, it will be
remembered and PACMAN will make that direction change at the first
possible opportunity, unless you enter a new direction in the interim.

Normally the monsters are chasing you.  When you eat an energizer, (the
little circles on the screen) you can eat monsters for bonus points. The
monsters will all change to diamond characters to signify that you are
in this state. When they are about to change back to monsters (blink
in the arcade PACMAN game) they will change to checkerboard characters.
When you eat all of the dots and energizers on the board, the game will
reset with a new board.  You get three PACMEN in the game, plus a bonus
one at 10000 points. The game ends when you run out of PACMEN.

Periodically, fruit will appear under the monsters' "prison".  You get
bonus points for eating these fruit, which appear as the letter A on the
first board, B on the second, etc., up to six boards.

At the side of the PACMAN maze you will have continually displayed your
current score, the number of PACMEN you have left, and the fruit you
have eaten.  Scoring is as follows:

	Dot          -   10 points
	Energizer    -   50 points
	Eating monsters:
	First        -  200 points
	Second       -  400 points
	Third        -  800 points
	Fourth       - 1600 points
	Fruit:
	A(apple)     -  100 points
	B(berry)     -  300 points
	C(cherry)    -  500 points 
	D(date)      -  700 points
	E(eggplant)  - 1000 points
	F(fig)       - 2000 points

The game will end automatically when you run out of PACMEN.  In addition,
you can end the game at any time by typing in a control-C.  The screen can
be "frozen" for interruptions or distractions by typing a control-S (or no-
scroll) and unfrozen by typing a control-Q (or no-scroll).

Enjoy!!
