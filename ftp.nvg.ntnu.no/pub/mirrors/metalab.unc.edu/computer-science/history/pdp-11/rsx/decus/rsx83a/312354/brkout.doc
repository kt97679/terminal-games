This game is similar to the arcade game, BRKOUT.  As written, it must
be played on a VT100 video terminal.  The screen consists of five rows of
bricks near the top, a bouncing ball, and a paddle along the bottom that
you can move left (by hitting the "4" key on the VT100 keypad) or right
(by hitting the "6" key on the VT100 keypad).  The idea is to destroy all
the bricks by hitting them with the ball.  The ball is in constant motion,
and bounces off walls, bricks, and your paddle.  If the ball moves off the
bottom of the screen without colliding with your paddle, it is lost.  When
you have lost three balls, the game is over.  Whenever all the bricks have
been destroyed, a new set of bricks appears and the game continues.  The
longer a ball remains on the screen, the faster it moves, making it 
increasingly difficult to keep it on the screen.

You can move the paddle in "steps" by hitting the 4 or 6 key repetitively,
or you can hold the key down for continuous motion in the selected direction.
Continuous motion requires the use of the VT100 autorepeat function, however,
which does not "kick in" until about a half-second after you hold the key
down.  There is thus a time lag between when you hold the key down, and
when continuous motion in the selected direction begins.

The scoring of the game is as follows:

bricks on the first row -   10 points
bricks on the second row -  20 points
bricks on the third row  -  30 points
bricks on the fourth row -  40 points
bricks on the fifth row  -  50 points

Thus, an entire screen of bricks is worth 2100 points.

Enjoy!!
